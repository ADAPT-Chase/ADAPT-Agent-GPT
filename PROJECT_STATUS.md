# ADAPT Agent GPT Project Status

This document provides an overview of the current status of the ADAPT Agent GPT project, including completed features, ongoing work, and future plans.

## Completed Features

1. Multi-Database Architecture
   - PostgreSQL integration for relational data (users, projects, tasks)
   - MongoDB integration for flexible document storage
   - Azure Cosmos DB integration for vector search and scalable NoSQL storage
   - Redis integration for caching (to be implemented)

2. Backend Development
   - FastAPI server setup
   - User authentication and authorization
   - CRUD operations for projects, tasks, and knowledge entries
   - Vector search functionality for knowledge base using Azure Cosmos DB

3. Frontend Development
   - React application setup
   - Basic UI components (NavBar, Footer, ErrorBoundary)
   - Authentication views (Login/Signup)
   - Dashboard view
   - Project Management view
   - Knowledge Base view with vector search capability

4. AI Integration
   - OpenAI GPT model integration for text generation and embeddings
   - Agent functionality for processing tasks, answering questions, and generating content

5. Development Environment
   - Environment variable configuration
   - Database initialization script
   - README and CONTRIBUTING guidelines

## Ongoing Work

1. Enhanced Error Handling
   - Implementing more robust error handling across the application
   - Improving error messages and logging

2. Testing
   - Writing unit tests for backend functions
   - Implementing integration tests for API endpoints
   - Creating frontend component tests

3. Performance Optimization
   - Optimizing database queries
   - Implementing caching strategies for frequently accessed data

4. Security Enhancements
   - Implementing rate limiting
   - Enhancing input validation and sanitization

## Planned Features

1. Advanced AI Capabilities
   - Implementing more sophisticated AI-driven task management
   - Enhancing the knowledge base with automatic categorization and summarization

2. Collaboration Features
   - Adding real-time collaboration on projects and tasks
   - Implementing a notification system

3. Data Visualization
   - Creating dashboards for project and task analytics
   - Implementing interactive visualizations for the knowledge base

4. Mobile Application
   - Developing a mobile version of the application for iOS and Android

5. API Documentation
   - Creating comprehensive API documentation using Swagger/OpenAPI

6. Internationalization
   - Adding support for multiple languages

7. Accessibility Improvements
   - Ensuring the application is fully accessible and WCAG compliant

## Known Issues

1. Performance issues with large datasets in the knowledge base (partially addressed with vector search)
2. Occasional timeouts when interacting with the AI model
3. Limited error handling for network issues in the frontend
