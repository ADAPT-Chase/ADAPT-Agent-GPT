- If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/yourusername/ADAPT-Agent-GPT/issues/new). Be sure to include a title and clear description, as much relevant information as possible, and a code sample or an executable test case demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

### Suggesting Enhancements

- Open a new issue with a clear title and detailed description of the suggested enhancement.
- Provide any relevant examples or mock-ups if applicable.

### Pull Requests

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. Ensure the test suite passes.
4. Make sure your code lints.
5. Issue that pull request!

## Styleguides

### Git Commit Messages

- Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
- Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
- Limit the first line to 72 characters or less
- Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line

### JavaScript Styleguide

- Use 2 spaces for indentation
- Use semicolons
- Use single quotes for strings
- Prefer `const` over `let` for declarations
