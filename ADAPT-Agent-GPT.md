   - FastAPI for the server
   - Python for business logic
   - Integration with AgentGPT
   - PostgreSQL database for data persistence

### Key Features
1. Enhanced AgentGPT capabilities
2. User authentication and authorization
3. Task management and tracking
4. Real-time updates and notifications
5. Data visualization dashboard
6. API integration for external services
7. User profile management

## Challenges and Solutions
1. Challenge: Integrating AgentGPT with custom features
   Solution: Developed a modular AgentGPT class that can be easily extended and integrated with FastAPI

2. Challenge: Ensuring real-time updates across the platform
   Solution: Implement WebSocket connections for live data transfer (to be implemented)

3. Challenge: Scalability of the system
   Solution: Design with microservices architecture in mind for future scaling

4. Challenge: Environment setup and dependency management
   Solution: Used nvm to manage Node.js versions and npm for package management

5. Challenge: Creating a responsive and user-friendly interface
   Solution: Utilized React components and CSS flexbox for a flexible layout

6. Challenge: Implementing secure user authentication
   Solution: Implemented JWT-based authentication on the backend and created a separate Auth component for the frontend

7. Challenge: Maintaining security best practices
   Solution: Used bcrypt for password hashing and implemented token-based authentication with expiration

8. Challenge: Managing authentication state across the application
   Solution: Utilized React's useState and useEffect hooks to manage authentication state and implemented a logout function

9. Challenge: Protecting backend routes
   Solution: Implemented JWT verification middleware for protected routes
