# ADAPT-Agent-GPT Project

## Blueprint

### Overview
ADAPT-Agent-GPT is a comprehensive and robust platform that combines the capabilities of AgentGPT with additional features and improvements. The platform consists of both a frontend and a backend, utilizing Express.js for server-side operations and React for the client-side.

### Architecture
1. Frontend:
   - React.js for dynamic UI components
   - Axios for API communication

2. Backend:
   - Express.js for the server
   - Node.js for business logic
   - Integration with AgentGPT
   - PostgreSQL database for data persistence
   - Sequelize as ORM
   - Node-RED for workflow automation

### Key Features
1. Enhanced AgentGPT capabilities
2. User authentication and authorization
3. Task management and tracking
4. Real-time updates and notifications
5. Data visualization dashboard
6. API integration for external services
7. User profile management
8. Admin functionality
9. File uploads
10. Continuous Integration and Deployment
11. Workflow automation with Node-RED
